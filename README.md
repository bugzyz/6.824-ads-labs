the 6.824 labs  
This is my answer of 6.824  
Course website: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html  

There are several branch in this repository. Why did i create so many branch?   
I think it will be convenient for you to check the answer of a specific steps in a lab.  
  
for example:  
    lab1_part1: only part1 code  
    lab2_part2: part1 + part2  
    lab2_part3: part2 + part3  
      
It's clear that you can get the pure step1 answer in branch-step1 without any other succeeding step code in it.  

Btw, the master branch is the original clean 6.824 code from the MIT-6.824 class  
And the dev branch is a branch maintaining the latest progress which follows the list below.  

- [x] Lab 1: MapReduce
-----------------------------
- [ ] Lab 2: Raft Consensus Algorithm
- [x]  part2A
- [ ]  part2B
- [ ]  part2C
-----------------------------
- [ ] Lab 3: Fault-tolerant Key/Value Service
-----------------------------
- [ ] Lab 4: Sharded Key/Value Service
